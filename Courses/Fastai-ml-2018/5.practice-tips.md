# Subsampling
At the beginning, try to create a small subset and explore the ideas to see how it works, what is the important features, how well which model works. Please note that you don't need to spend much time to tune the model to have very high accurate at this stage. This stage is more focus on proving the concet only.

> Do most of your models on a large enough sample size that your accuracy is reasonable (within a reasonable distance of the best accuracy you can get) and taking a small number of seconds to train so that you can interactively do your analysis.
