# Cross Validation
Split the randomly shuffle data into N splits, and take N-1 splits to train and the left one to evaluate, then everage the final score.

## Cross-validation vs. standard validation set
The benefit is it could be able to use all the data.

## What scenarios should not use cross-validation?
1. Large dataset which take a long time to train
2. Random validation set is not appropriate for the problem, like temporal data


# Tools

## Waterfall plots
> Every time you have a starting point and a number of changes and a finishing point, waterfall charts are pretty much always the best way to show it.
