In classical machine learning, the complexity is controlled by reducing number of parameters while in the modern machine learning it is by regularization. But still, the parameters in model machine learning rather not use more than we need.

## Tree model vs. SGD
In resolving linear type problem:
- SGD (single layer or multi-layer model) don't have to worry about collinearity (at least not that much as tree model)
- Tree complains less. like, it doesn't need to normalize continuous variable
